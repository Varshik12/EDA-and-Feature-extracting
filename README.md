# EDA-and-Feature-extracting
This repository contains Python code for performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Extraction**, essential steps in preparing datasets for machine learning and statistical modeling tasks.

---

## **Features**
- Perform initial exploratory data analysis to understand dataset structure
- Handle missing values, outliers, and perform data cleaning
- Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Extract important features for model training and optimization

---

## **Technologies Used**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (for feature extraction techniques)
